2. Use "curve.css" in the main directory as your stylesheet, linking it as "../../curveship"
3. Include no fewer than 6 events and no more than 10 events in the story.js you write
4. Write 3 different sets of narrator files (html and js) with matching, descriptive filenames, e.g., surprised.html and surprised.js
