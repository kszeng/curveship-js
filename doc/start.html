<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<h2>in Curveship-js</h2>

<p>The first step in getting started is to read about <a href="concepts.html">Curveship-js concepts.</a> The essential concepts, and their associated terms, are referred to throughout this guide.</p>

<p>The recommended way to write a new Curveship-js story file, narrator files, and the corresponding HTML pages is by modifying existing files. In this guide, however, we’ll pretend that we’re writing a <a href="#story"><i>story</i></a> called “The Simulated Bank Robbery” from scratch, and then, we’ll pretend that we’re writing a <a href="#narrator"><i>narrator</i></a> who is casual and oblique, again from scratch. Finally, we’ll see quickly how to <a href="#connect"><i>connect</i></a> these two files with a Web page.</p>

<h2 id="story">The Story File</h2>

<p>Easy things are meant to be easy to do in Curveship-js. For instance, it should be easy to define a story that is like a folk tale, with straightforward story elements and little underlying complexity in terms of what fundamentally happens. See <a href="examples/robbery/story.js" target="_blank">robbery/story.js</a> for one reasonably simple example, with only a few special nuances; even simpler is <a href="examples/waiting/story.js" target="_blank">waiting/story.js.</a></p>

<p>To write a Curveship-js story file ending in ".js" one needs only define the title, define <b>Places, Actors, and Things,</b> specify a sequence of <b>Events,</b> and then conclude with a final, standard line.</p>

<p>For clarity, put the title right up top, after any comments you would like to add with your (the author’s) name, a copyright message, and license information:</p>

<pre>
  var title = "The Simulated Bank Robbery";
</pre>

<h2>Defining Existents</h2>

<p>After specifying the title, list your Places. Each time you add a line, you’re creating a new Place, and the required JavaScript syntax helps to indicate that:</p>

<pre>
place.vestibule = new Place();
place.lobby = new Place();
place.guardPost = new Place();
place.street = new Place();
</pre>

<p>These four places have four <i>tags,</i> “vestibule”, “lobby”, “guardPost”, and “street”. The tags are <i>not</i> what these places end up being called. Nothing in the story file indicates what they will be called. Tags are just the way to refer to these places within the story and narrator files. Tags need to be unique across all Existents. For instance, not only can there only be one Place with the tag “street” — once that tag has been used for a Place, it also cannot be used for an Actor or a Thing.</p>

<p>After this, list your Actors. You use the same syntax, but this time arguments are included to indicate where the Actor is and (optionally) what gender the actor is:</p>

<pre>
actor.teller = new Actor(place.vestibule, "female");
actor.robber = new Actor(place.street, "male");
actor.guard = new Actor(place.guardPost, "male");
</pre>

<p>Of the three sorts of Existents, Things come last. They are also each located somewhere. Their location can be a Place, an Actor (if an Actor is carrying them), or even another Thing (if that other Thing is a container, for instance).</p>

<pre>
thing.slip = new Thing(place.vestibule);
thing.fakeMoney = new Thing(place.vestibule);
thing.bag = new Thing(place.vestibule);
thing.mask = new Thing(actor.robber);
thing.fakeGun = new Thing(actor.robber);
thing.pistol = new Thing(actor.guard);
</pre>

<p>At the end of this sequence, we can (optionally) provide some additional information, for instance, information about Actors owning Things. This can end up having implications for the generation of possessive noun phrases, eventually:</p>

<pre>
thing.fakeGun.setOwner(actor.robber);
thing.pistol.setOwner(actor.guard);
</pre>

<h2>The Event Sequence</h2>

<p>What remains is to provide a sequence of Events, describing what <i>happens.</i> Events are given tags, just like Existents. They always have an agent (who is performing the action, the first argument). For “intransitive” actions, that’s usually all there is. But they can also have an object (what is acted upon). If they do, that's the second argument. Here’s the beginning of the Event sequence, where events 1, 3, 4, and 8 have direct objects:</p>

<pre>
ev.read = new Event(actor.teller, thing.slip);
ev.snooze = new Event(actor.guard);
ev.reread = new Event(actor.teller, thing.slip);
ev.coverFace = new Event(actor.robber, thing.mask);
ev.type = new Event(actor.teller);
ev.play = new Event(actor.teller);
ev.beginRobbing = new Event(actor.robber);
ev.wave = new Event(actor.teller, actor.robber);
</pre>

<p>If an Event also has an indirect object (something indirectly affected by the action), a temporal relationship needs to be specified as the third argument. Then the indirect object is the fourth argument, as seen in the next event:</p>

<pre>
ev.threaten = new Event(actor.robber, actor.teller, temporal.using, thing.fakeGun);
ev.laugh = new Event(actor.teller);
ev.wake = new Event(actor.guard);
ev.seeThreat = new Event(actor.guard, actor.robber);
ev.leavePost = new Event(actor.guard, place.guardPost);
ev.grabFake = new Event(actor.teller, thing.fakeMoney, temporal.into, thing.bag);
ev.turn = new Event(actor.robber, actor.guard);
ev.shoot1 = new Event(actor.guard, actor.robber);
ev.shoot2 = new Event(actor.guard, actor.robber);
ev.fall = new Event(actor.robber);
ev.die = new Event(actor.robber);
ev.dropGun = new Event(actor.guard, thing.pistol);
</pre>

<p>Events can <i>reconfigure</i> Existents. When the guard drops the gun, for instance, according to this story, he “disowns” it. It no longer belongs to him:</p>

<pre>
ev.dropGun.reconfigures(thing.pistol, "owner", actor.guard, actor.cosmos);
</pre>

<p>Here’s the rest of the Event sequence:</p>

<pre>
ev.regret = new Event(actor.guard, ev.shoot1);
ev.cry = new Event(actor.teller);
ev.stare = new Event(actor.guard, thing.pistol);
</pre>

<h2>Wrapping Up the Story File</h2>

<p>In a standard story file, the final line is:</p>

<pre>
  var world = new World(place, actor, category, thing, ev);
</pre>

<p>Categories, by the way, are an advanced, experimental, and definitely optional feature. There are none in “The Simulated Bank Robbery” and their use is not supported in this release. But formula nevertheless requires that this last line, exactly as it appears above, is included. This builds a new storyworld with all the components that have been previously defined.</p>

<h2 id="narrator">A Narrator File</h2>

<p>Once the story elements are defined in story.js, it is time to create a new file in the director, a 'narrator.js' file. This file will instruct the system about the discourse, the particular words, and inflections used to tell the story.  A story may have many narrations. Thus, one story.js content file can be used by multiple narrator files. </p>

<p>Each narrator file should be named descriptively. For our example, if we want to create a casual narrator on the story. We would name the narrator file "casual.js" to distinguish this from other narratives.  Take a look at the HTML files in the <a href="../examples">example</a> folders and note how different narrations can result from a single story file. Other narrative examples you can find are surprised.js, prim.js, fabular.js.</p>

<p>The narrator file begins with a comment about the title, creator, and license.  After this frontmatter, define the narrator, or who is telling the story. This <b>toldBy</b> variable introduces the particular narrator. This byline will be under the title in the resulting HTML narration.</p>

<pre>var toldBy = "a casual storyteller";</pre>

<p>The next section of code sets any optional <a href="reference.html#spin">spin</a> parameters. Spin offers many possible narrative controls so please see the <a href="reference.html#spin"> reference</a>.</p>

<p>Next, the <b>Names</b> corresponding to the existents are declared. These names should match the tags used in the story content file (story.js). The convention is to order the names according to the order in which they appear in the corresponding story file: Places first, then Actors, and lastly, Things.</p>

The simplest way to name an existent is to give one name (a string) to refer to that tag. Every time the existent appears in the narration, that name will be used. More sophisticated naming, such as common or general names can be specified by adding a second argument. The first name is used the first time that existent is introduced. The second argument is the generic name to be used thereafter in the telling.

<pre>
names.lobby = new Names("the lobby");
names.street = new Names("the sidewalk outside the bank", "the sidewalk");
</pre>

<p>One can specify proper names or gender pronouns using <b>ProperNames</b>. ProperNames arguments consist of the First, then the Last name, followed by the gender pronoun, the common name, then an honorific title.</p>
<pre>
names.louise = new ProperNames("Louise", "Mallard", pronoun.feminine, "the wife", "Mrs.");
</pre>
<p>In the above line, the Existent <b>louise</b> is referred to with the first and last name of "Louise Mallard" when she is introduced. Afterward, she is referred to by the feminine pronoun "she" or informally as "the wife."  However, the narrator can also use an honorific reference for this <b>Actor</b>, e.g. "Mrs. Mallard." See the example story and narration files in the <a href="../examples/hour/">Story of an Hour</a> where the narrator refers to Louise by different names.</p>

<p>Note that Curveship may also allow the naming of categories, parts, and properties. These are <a href="concepts.html#experimental">experimental features</a>.</p>
<p>The next large section will define the Verb Phrase (VP) for each event used in the narration. The tag for each VP must correlate to the event tags listed in the story file.  In Curveship, each VP defines the verb and the inflection that the system will use to realize the event.</p>

<p>For a casual narrator, the following VPs may be listed.</p>
<pre>
vp.eat = new VerbPh("eat");
vp.request = new VerbPh("ask");
</pre>

In contrast, an exaggerating narrator uses more dramatic wording:
<pre>
vp.eat = new VerbPh("devour ravenously");
vp.request = new VerbPh("implore desperately");
</pre>

Finally, end the file with the <b>run</b> function so that Curveship can realize the narration. The narrator file must end with the following line:</p>

<pre>
function run() { narrate(title, toldBy, world, spin, names, vp); }
</pre>
<p>Now you are ready to view the output. In the next section, you'll tell Curveship how to link up the story and narrator files. 
</p>
<h2 id="connecting">Connecting Story and Narrator with a Web Page</h2>
<p>Curveship realizes the story as an HTML file by combining the story file with a narrator file.</p>

<p>Create a .html file that matches the descriptive filename of the narrator file created above. For example, if the narrator file is named "casual.js" then the HTML file should be named "casual.html". After the usual HTML doctype and header declaration, add a link to the stylesheet "curve.css" in the main curveship directory.</p>

<pre>
&lt;link rel="StyleSheet" href="../curve.css"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>The next lines includes the Curveship source files. These lines must appear exactly as shown.
<pre>
&lt;script src="../../curveship.js"&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="../../noun.js">&lt;script&gt;
&lt;script src="../../verb.js">&lt;script&gt;
</pre>

Then, link the source files for the narration. First, include the story content file. Then, add the corresponding narrator to the HTML file. So, if you are creating a casual narrator (casual.html), the final lines in the header should look like this:
<pre>
&lt;script src="story.js">&lt;script&gt;
&lt;script src="casual.js">&lt;script&gt;
</pre>
<p>
After closing the header, the next section is the document body. Add a call to the <b>run()</b> function to run Curveship when the file is loaded. Inside the HTML body, add a div named "narrative" where Curveship will generate the discourse. End the file by closing the body and html tags so that it is a valid HTML file. Save the HTML file.
</p> 
<pre>
&lt;body onload="run()"&gt;
&lt;div id="narrative">&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>To view this output, open the HTML file in a web browser.  Explore the HTML files in the <a href="../examples">examples</a> directory for some sample narratives.</p>
